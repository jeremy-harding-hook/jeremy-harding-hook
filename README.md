<p>I'm a C# dev in my day job, but my personal projects vary. At home I use Linux, and I'd like to move towards C programming or potentially C++.<br>
I'm willing to try any and every language at least once, though I will say working in Javascript results in a cpl (complaints per line) of roughly 30%. Sadly I haven't gotten the chance to work in a proper functional language yet.<br>
I'll probably make most of my projects public in case anyone can see any use for them (or just find them interesting), but for the most part they tend to be projects with a very niche application.</p>
